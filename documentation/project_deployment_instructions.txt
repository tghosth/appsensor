Instructions primarily taken from http://central.sonatype.org/pages/apache-maven.html

Basic steps:

One time:
----
- setup gpg public / private key pairs
- setup settings.xml username / pw that is configured as owner / contributor at sonatype
 
Each deploy: 
----
- update website
	- index.html (version of book, snapshot, release - all that have changed)
	- getting-started.html (version of snapshot or release - all that have changed)
	- from folder w/ app.yaml, run 'python ~/development/google_appengine/appcfg.py --oauth2 update .'
	
- for a snapshot deployment: 
	- ensure all versions end in '-SNAPSHOT' (run 'mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.3-SNAPSHOT -DgenerateBackupPoms=false')
	- also run this step separately for appsensor-ui since it's on a different release cycle
	- need to run 'mvn -N install' (installs parent pom locally to run remainder of cases)
	- run 'mvn clean deploy'
	
- for a release deployment: 
	- ensure all versions DO NOT end in '-SNAPSHOT' (run 'mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.2.3 -DgenerateBackupPoms=false')
	- also run this step separately for appsensor-ui since it's on a different release cycle
	- need to run 'mvn -N install' (installs parent pom locally to run remainder of cases)
	- update the changelog
	- run 'mvn clean deploy -P release'
		- need to deploy and activate release profile (-P release)
		- this is needed to execute the gpg/javadoc/source plugins
	- create documentation folder (for non-RC releases)
		- create a v${version} folder (for 2.1.2, it would be 'v2.1.2') in appsensor-dot-org/docs
		- build the javadoc
			- run 'mvn javadoc:aggregate'
			- copy the 'target/site/apidocs' folder to the 'appsensor-dot-org/docs/${version}/javadoc'
			- copy the results from the 'wsdocs/apidocs' dir over to 'appsensor-dot-org/docs/${version}/api' folder
			- add a link to the 'api.html' page for the new javadoc folder
	- commit code
	- tag the github repo with the appropriate tag (gpg signed) (run "git tag -u 'jtmelton@gmail.com' -s v1.2.3 -m 'appsensor release version 1.2.3'")
	- push tags (run 'git push origin --tags')
	- create a release (https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases - use the pre-release flag if this is an alpha, beta or RC release)
